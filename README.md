# sign-up-form
This mock sign up form was created with HTML, CSS, Flexbox and a simple JS password match validator. The goal of this project was to gain experience with HTML form elements, page structure and data validation. Additionally, CSS styling, pseudo-classes and realative units. 

The focus on this project was not mobile design, as a result it lacks resposniveness on mobile. However, desktop viewing is intended to be reponsive.
